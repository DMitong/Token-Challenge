# Token Smart Contract

## Background

The smart contract in this repository is part of a 15 day smart contract building challenge. The challenge has three levels of difficulty, namely:

- Basic: The challenges from Day 1 to Day 5
- Intermediate: The challenges from Day 6 to Day 10
- Advanced: The challenges from Day 11 to Day 15

## Challenge Task: Basic 2

Write a smart contract that can create and transfer tokens. The contract should have a mapping that stores the balances of each address. The contract should also have a function to mint new tokens and assign them to the contract owner. The contract should also have a function to transfer tokens from one address to another, only if the sender has enough balance.
